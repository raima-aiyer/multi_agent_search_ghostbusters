### Multi-Agent Search Project (Pacman with Ghosts)

In this project, I implemented search algorithms for a multi-agent Pacman environment, introducing adversarial and probabilistic agents (ghosts). Key tasks included:

- Built a smarter **Reflex Agent** that considers food and ghost proximity for better decision-making.
- Implemented **Minimax** search to model adversarial agents optimally.
- Added **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to improve minimax search efficiency by reducing unnecessary exploration.
- Developed an **Expectimax Agent** to model opponents with probabilistic, non-optimal behaviors.
- Designed custom evaluation functions to balance risk and reward when facing multiple agents.

The project was adapted from UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS188 and completed as part of ASU's CSE 471 course.
